- Document everything!
- Make the code pass pylint
- `CaughtDB`:
    - Add a `getPokemonByDexno` method
    - `newGame` should take an argument to control whether a
      `version:playername[:N]` synonym is created
    - Should `create` ensure the dexnos are all positive & contiguous?
    - Try to make `create` rollback the CREATE TABLE statements (not just the
      INSERT statements) when an INSERT fails
    - Let `create` use either a TSV file or JSON file as the Pokédex
    - Should more SQL calls be given custom types for their exceptions?  (At
      the very least, those that can propagate to the top of caught.py during
      normal execution should be more end-user friendly)
    - Add a method for testing whether `create` has been run on the DB
    - `newGame` should probably take a `Game` as its argument
    - The `synonyms` attributes of Game and Pokemon objects should not include
      the canonical name.

- `caught.py`:
    - Intended command-line usages to implement:

        caught list status game [pokemon|dexno|dexno_range ...]
        # Statuses:
        # - uncaught
        # - caught
        # - caught+ - equivalent to `caught/owned`
        # - owned
        # - status1/status2 - all Pokémon with either status
        # - status1/status2/status3 - all Pokémon (just for completeness's sake)

        caught get game [pokemon|dexno|dexno_range ...]

        caught getall [--games game1,game2]  # List all Pokémon in all games in a table
        caught getall [--games game1,game2] pokemon|dexno|dexno_range ...

        caught update tsvfile|jsonfile  # add more Pokémon

        caught export [-o file] [game ...]
        # Exports all games by default (as JSON?)

        caught import [file | -]

    - Add functionality for automatically backing up the database?
        - Idea: Add a program-wide option for backing up the database before
          performing any operations, and add a command for restoring from a
          backup
    - Fill in 'help', 'metavar', and other help message-related values for
      argparse
    - Add a command for showing all information about a specific Pokémon?
    - Give `new` an option to turn off creation of the `version:playername[:N]`
      synonym
    - Give `new` an option for setting the game ID?
    - Rename `new` to "`newgame`"?
    - Make warning and error messages look less alike
    - Give the `add` family a "verbose" option to make them print out each
      specified Pokémon's previous status and whether or not a change was made

- Add functionality for extending/updating the Pokédex
- Should CaughtDB and/or caught.py raise an error when trying to set the status
  for a Pokémon that is beyond a game's dexsize?
- Add support for keeping track of Unown forms
- Add support for regional Pokédexes
- Add a "seen" status
- Add commands & methods for adding & removing game synonyms
- Merge `caughtdb.py` back into `caught.py`
- Rethink whether each Pokémon should have its dexno as an synonym
- Add a table (and a TSV file) listing possible versions and their
  corresponding dexsizes (and, eventually, regional dexes)
- TO IMPLEMENT: When looking up a game by name, if there exists a `game_names`
  entry for that name, it is used.  Otherwise, all games whose `version` and/or
  `player_name` equals the supplied string are queried; if there is exactly
  one, it is used, otherwise it is an error.
    - Add a `getGameByName` method that (unlike `getGame`) only searches the
      `game_names` table (and add an option to `caught.py` for making use of
      it)
- Instead of the version+player_name+synonyms system, each game should have a
  single canonical name (which is used in the headings of tabular output) and
  zero or more synonyms, with 'version' and 'player_name' being (optional?)
  extra fields that are not used in naming and simply describe the game further
  (and can be searched, e.g., getting all Diamond games?)
- Generalize the code into being able to track completion of sets
  (corresponding to games) of arbitrary checklists
