- Document everything!
- Make the code pass pylint
- `CaughtDB`:
    - Add a `getPokemonByDexno` method
    - Should `create` ensure the dexnos are all positive & contiguous?
    - Try to make `create` rollback the CREATE TABLE statements (not just the
      INSERT statements) when an INSERT fails
    - Let `create` use either a TSV file or JSON file as the Pokédex
    - Should more SQL calls be given custom types for their exceptions?  (At
      the very least, those that can propagate to the top of `caught.py` during
      normal execution should be more end-user friendly)
    - Add a method for testing whether `create` has been run on the DB
    - `newGame` should probably take a `Game` as its argument
    - The `synonyms` attributes of Game and Pokemon objects should not include
      the canonical name (or, for Pokemon, the dexno)
    - Should `getGame` fall back to looking up by gameID if no name is found?
    - When `getGame` is called, if there exists a `game_names` entry for that
      name, that should be returned.  Otherwise, all games whose `version`
      and/or `player_name` fields equal the supplied string are queried; if
      there is exactly one, it is returned, otherwise it is an error.
        - Add a `getGameByName` method that only searches the `game_names`
          table (and add an option to `caught.py` for making use of it)
    - The following methods need to be better about rolling back changes if an
      exception is thrown in the middle of execution:
        - `create`
        - `newGame`
    - Add a method and/or DB constraint for ensuring there are no `UNCAUGHT`
      entries in `caught`?

- `caught.py`:
    - Intended command-line usages to implement:

        caught list status game [pokemon|dexno|dexno_range ...]
        # Statuses:
        # - uncaught
        # - caught
        # - caught+ - equivalent to `caught/owned`
        # - owned
        # - status1/status2 - all Pokémon with either status
        # - status1/status2/status3 - all Pokémon (just for completeness's sake)

        caught update tsvfile|jsonfile  # add more Pokémon

        caught export [-o file] [game ...]
        # Exports all games by default (as JSON?)

        caught import [file | -]

    - Add functionality for automatically backing up the database?
        - Idea: Add a program-wide option for backing up the database before
          performing any operations, and add a command for restoring from a
          backup
    - Fill in 'help', 'metavar', and other help message-related values for
      argparse
    - Add a command for showing all information about a specific Pokémon?
    - Give `new` an option for setting the game ID?
    - Rename `new` to "`newgame`"?
    - Make warning and error messages look less alike
    - Give the `add` family a "verbose" option to make them print out each
      specified Pokémon's previous status and whether or not a change was made
    - Let `getall` take multiple `--games` switches (and/or multiple `--game`
      switches, allowing it to subsume `get`?)
    - Improve the output of `getall`
        - Handle padding with non-ASCII characters
    - Rename the `-G` option
    - Let the `add` family, `get`, and `getall` take Pokémon specifications as
      species names, dexnos, or ranges (given as two species and/or dexnos
      separated by a hyphen)

- Add functionality for extending/updating the Pokédex
- Should CaughtDB and/or caught.py raise an error when trying to set the status
  for a Pokémon that is beyond a game's dexsize?
- Add support for keeping track of Unown forms
- Add support for regional Pokédexes
- Add a "seen" status
- Add commands & methods for adding & removing game synonyms
- Add functionality for changing a game's canonical name, version, and player
  name (and dexsize?)
- Merge `caughtdb.py` back into `caught.py`
- Rethink whether each Pokémon should have its dexno as an synonym
- Add a table (and a TSV file) listing possible versions and their
  corresponding dexsizes (and, eventually, regional dexes)
- Add functionality for getting games by version & player name

- Generalize the code into being able to track completion of sets
  (corresponding to games) of arbitrary checklists
