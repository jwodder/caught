## Very Rough Documentation

### Command-line functionality already implemented

- The `-D`/`--dbfile` and `-G` global options
- By default, "game" arguments that are all digits are interpreted as game IDs,
  unless the program-wide option `-G` is supplied, which forces them to be
  interpreted as regular names.
- The `add` family and `get` take Pokémon specifications as species names,
  dexnos, or ranges (given as two species and/or dexnos separated by a hyphen).
